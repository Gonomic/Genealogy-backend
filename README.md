# Genealogy-backend

Contains the MySQL backend files for the Genealogy app

## General purpose of the Genealogy app

The general purpose of the Genealogy app is to learn about- and further progress on MySQL, Sails, Node, JS, Angular, SVG (SnapSVG) and GIT.
The Genealogy App will aid this purpose, but the app is not the purpose itself. The Genealogy app will consist of a MySQL backend, SailsJS as middleware and a Javascript / Angular (so also Typescript) frontend.
The backend and middleware will run on privately hosted docker containers. The frontend will initially run as a simple WebApp for plain browsers, but is planned to be expanded into Mobile apps for Android as well as IOS and later on also Electron (so for use on full clients). The frontend will also be run a privately hosted docker container, but this one will eventually be exposed to the Internet. 

## Specific purpose of this repo

The specific purpose of this repo is to contain all MySQL files required to build, further develop and maintain the MySQL backend for the Genealogy app. Later I will add to this readme.md file explanations on the included files and how to use them.

## Very much "Under Construction"!

First steps for the middleware and the web client have also already been made, but are until now contained in a private GIT repo. These repo's will be made available public shortly. So if it seems that things are not complete by looking at this public repo, we'll, that's (partially) true at this moment :-). So please bear with me!
