# Genealogy-backend

Contains the MySQL backend files for the Genealogy app

## General purpose of the Genealogy app

The general purpose of the Genealogy app is to learn about- and further progress on MySQL, Sails, Node, JS, Angular, SVG (SnapSVG) and GIT.
The Genealogy App will aid this putpose, but is not the purpose itself The Genealogy app will consist of a MySQL backend, SailsJS as middleware and a Javascript / Angular (so also Typescript) frontend.
The backend and middleware will run on privately histed docker containers. The backend will initially run as a simple WebApp for plain browsers, but is planned to be expanded into Mobile apps for Android as well as IOS and later on also Electron. 

## Specific purpose of this repo

The specific purpose of this repo is to contain all MySQL files required to build, further develop and maintain the MySQL backend. Later I will add to this readme.md file expanations on the included files and how to use them.

## Very much "Under Construction"!

First steps for the middleware and the web client have already been made, but are until now contained in a private GIT repo. These repo's will be made available public shortly. So if it seems that things are not complete, we'll, that's (partially) true at this moment :-). So please bear with me!
